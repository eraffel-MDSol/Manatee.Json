# 13.0.2

([#271](https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Json/issues/271)) Concurrency issue while validating meta-schemas in parallel.

Fixed the `contains` / `minContains` relationship to respect when `minContains` is zero.  The spec specifies that `contains` should pass in this case.  References: [Specification discussion](https://github.com/json-schema-org/json-schema-spec/issues/924) and [test discussion](https://github.com/json-schema-org/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite/pull/368).

# 13.0.1

([#269](https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Json/issues/269)) The reported bug was that the download method in the schema options wasn't always hitting.  What ended up being the issue was that the schema draft wasn't always being determined correctly, and with the recent changes in v13, schemas were always being evaluated as draft 2019-09, even if the `$schema` keyword declared otherwise.  This had some side effects around always processing `$ref`-sibling keywords, which drafts prior to 2019-09 don't allow.

# 13.0.0

*Released on 3 May, 2020*

<span id="break">breaking change</span><span id="feature">feature</span><span id="patch">patch</span>

([#260](https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Json/pull/260)) Performance enhancements for `JsonPointer`.  Also updates how evaluated properties & items are tracked in schemas.

([#263](https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Json/issues/263)) `JsonSchemaOptions.BasicDownload` shouldn't write to the console.

([#265](https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Json/issues/265)) `DateTime` serialization doesn't format ISO-8601 properly.

([#261](https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Json/pull/261)) More enhancements around how evaluated properties & items are tracked in schemas.

([#241](https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Json/issues/241)) Complete overhaul of the schema `format` keyword validation system.

([#267](https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Json/issues/267)) JSON parsing should throw when there is more content after the completion of the value.

([#266](https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Json/issues/266)) Migrated `JsonSchemaOptions` to be used as an instance class so that several schemas can be used with differing options.

## Bug Fixes

- ISO 8601 DateTime serialization now uses the `O` format instead of the `s` format.  (See [.Net `DateTime` formatting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-date-and-time-format-strings).)  Additionally, deserialization now assumes universal times.
- Setting `JsonSerializerOptions.CustomDateTimeSerializationFormat` now automatically sets `DateTimeSerializationFormat` to `Custom`.

## Additions

- `JsonOptions.RequireIsolatedJsonDuringParse` - Specifies whether content is allowed after JSON parsing completes a value.  The default behavior is the same as in v12: additional content is allowed.
- `JsonSchema`
  - `ProcessingVersion` - Allows a schema to be explicitly processed as a specific draft.  Normally, this would be assessed during the first validation by examining the set of keywords present (including the `$schema`).  This allows subversion of this process.  It also works together with the new `JsonSchemaOptions.DefaultProcessingVersion` property to indicate exactly which draft is being used.
  - `Validate()` and `ValidateSchema()` now accept an optional `JsonSchemaOptions` parameter.
  - `Validate(SchemaValidationContext)` has been made public.  This is to be used by custom keywords, not to initiate validation.
- `JsonSchemaOptions`:
  - Static `Default` - the default instance of the options.  Used to create new instances when not provided by the user.
  - Parameterless and copy constructors.
  - `LogMetaSchemaValidation` - A value of `true` will instruct the logging subsystem to not create log entries when validating metaschemas.  This can help isolate logs that pertain directly to a validation.
  - `DefaultProcessingVersion` - A priority-ordered list of schema draft versions that will serve to determine which draft will be used for a schema.
- `IRequireAnnotations` - Schema keywords can implement this interface to indicate that they require annotation results from other keywords in order to do their job properly.  Examples of these are the `unevaluated*` keywords, which require some special property & item tracking.  Not having these keywords in your schemas can increase performance significantly as optimizations have been added for when these keywords are absent.
- `SchemaValidationContext`
  - `ShouldTrackValidatedValues` - Works together with `IRequireAnnotations` keywords to control how evaluated properties & items are tracked.
  - `Options` - The set of options used during the specific validation pass.
- `IFormatValidator` - See "Formats" section below for more details on the changes on how schema formatting has changed.

## Breaking Changes

- `FluentBuilderExtensions.Format(JsonSchema, Format)` (used for fluent-building schemas) replaced with two new versions:
  - `FluentBuilderExtensions.Format(JsonSchema, string)`
  - `FluentBuilderExtensions.Format(JsonSchema, IFormatValidator)`
- `GetterExtensions.Format(JsonSchema)` now returns `string` of the format key instead of a `Format` instance.
- `Format` class changed to `Formats` static class.
  - All static properties that represent formats have been changed to return `IFormatValidator`.
  - `GetFormat(string)` now returns `IFormatValidator`.
  - See "Formats" section below for more details on the changes on how schema formatting has changed.
- `JsonSchema`
  - `RegisterSubschemas(Uri, JsonSchemaRegistry)` ðŸ – `RegisterSubschemas(SchemaValidationContext)`
  - `ResolveSubschema(JsonPointer, Uri)` ðŸ – `ResolveSubschema(JsonPointer, Uri, JsonSchemaVersion)`
- `IJsonSchemaKeyword`
  - `RegisterSubschemas(Uri, JsonSchemaRegistry)` ðŸ – `RegisterSubschemas(SchemaValidationContext)`
  - `ResolveSubschema(JsonPointer, Uri)` ðŸ – `ResolveSubschema(JsonPointer, Uri, JsonSchemaVersion)`
  - Same change applied to all keywords.
- `IJsonSchemaDependency`
  - `RegisterSubschemas(Uri, JsonSchemaRegistry)` ðŸ – `RegisterSubschemas(SchemaValidationContext)`
  - `ResolveSubschema(JsonPointer, Uri)` ðŸ – `ResolveSubschema(JsonPointer, Uri, JsonSchemaVersion)`
  - Same change applied to both implementations.
- `JsonSchemaOptions` migrated to an instance class.  This class can be passed into the validation methods and will be added to the context.
  - The exception to this migration is the `Download` property, which remains static.
- `FormatKeyword.Value` now returns `string` instead of `Format`.

### Format Overhaul

As was discussed in [#241](https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Json/issues/241), the format validation framework had its issues.

- It was difficult or confusing to add custom formats.
- Overriding existing formats just didn't work right.

As such, it has been overhauled to use individual format validator classes.  Each of these classes implements a new interface, `IFormatValidator`, and handles validation for a single format.

By default, the formats defined by the spec have default implementations and are pre-registered.  New formats can be added by implementing `IFormatValidator` and supplying an instance to the new `Formats.RegisterValidator(IFormatValidator)` static method.  Additionally, this same method can be used to supercede the in-built registrations.  The static properties are still there and will return the handler for that format, even when overridden.

A minor behavior change is that serialization will no longer throw an exception when encountering unknown formats.  It will still throw on validation if configured to do so, however.

# 12.0.0

*Released on 18 Dec, 2019*

<span id="break">breaking change</span><span id="feature">feature</span><span id="patch">patch</span>

This change primarily adds .Net Core 3.0 support.  It has also been updated to support null reference types.

## Logging

Some cursory verbose logging has been introduced to allow the client to see what decisions Manatee.Json is making during (primarily) schema validation and serialization.  The `JsonOptions.Log` static property has been introduced for this purpose.  It is of type `ILog` which exposes a single method, `Verbose(string, LogCategory)`.

The log categories currently are general, serialization, and schema.  This allows the client to enable or disable certain activities, so that, for instance, they can only enable schema validation logging if they wish.  The `JsonOptions.LogCategory` static property controls what categories are actually sent.

**There is no default implementation for `ILog`.**  Keeping this option null will ensure faster processing in production scenarios.  This logging feature is intended for research and debugging purposes only as there are *a lot* of logs which can add processing time.

## Bug fixes

`unevaluatedItems` would not properly process items that nested keywords touched but failed.  See [JSON-Schema-Test-Suite #291](https://github.com/json-schema-org/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite/issues/291) for details and an example of the logging mentioned above.

## Breaking Changes

- `JsonValue` parameterless constructor removed.  Use `JsonValue.Null` instead.
- `JsonValue` parameterized constructor arguments changed to non-nullable or will throw `ArgumentNullException`.
- `JsonArray.OfType(JsonValueType)` now throws `ArgumentNullException` when passed a null array.
- `JsonSyntaxException.Source` replaced by `SourceData` so that it doesn't hide `Exception.Source`.
- `SerializationContext` used only for serialization now.  `DeserializationContext` now introduced for deserialization.  This changes method signatures for `ISerializer`.  Additional notes below.

### Serialization changes

In an effort to reduce memory footprint, a single `SerializationContext`/`DeserializationContext` instance will be retained throughout the serialization/deserialization process.  To facilitate this, new instances will no longer be created when a serializer needs to serialize an object's contents; instead it will "push" new details onto the existing context, serialize, then "pop" the details when finished.

For example, the internal `ListSerializer` in versions up to v11 would serialize a list's contents using [this code](https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Json/blob/7b5fa44bd2ece54dc616716482284baaca72ed35/Manatee.Json/Serialization/Internal/Serializers/ListSerializer.cs#L23-L34):

```c#
for (int i = 0; i < array.Length; i++)
{
    var newContext = new SerializationContext(context)
    {
        CurrentLocation = context.CurrentLocation.CloneAndAppend(i.ToString()),
        InferredType = list[i]?.GetType() ?? typeof(T),
        RequestedType = typeof(T),
        Source = list[i]
    };

    array[i] = context.RootSerializer.Serialize(newContext);
}
```

However, creating a new context instance for each item is resource intensive and creates a lot of work for the garbage collector afterward.

Instead we simply push new details onto the existing context before we serialize an item, then pop those details afterward, like [this](https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Json/blob/929e6d1b922df5f774522e0743cc05d19e2527b9/Manatee.Json/Serialization/Internal/Serializers/ListSerializer.cs#L23-L28):

```c#
for (int i = 0; i < array.Length; i++)
{
    context.Push(list[i]?.GetType() ?? typeof(T), typeof(T), i.ToString(), list[i]);
    array[i] = context.RootSerializer.Serialize(context);
    context.Pop();
}
```

The values that we push are

- The inferred type of the object we're pushing (or the requested type if the inferred type is null)
- The requested type
- The JSON path segment (in this case the index)
- The object to be serialized

These are maintained in a stack internally to the context object and are removed on the `Pop()` call, keeping the context synchronized with the serialization process.

## Breaking changes

### Schema

In order to support some new independent reference tests, some changes were made to the schema validation logic to include a validation-run-independent schema registry, separate from the static one.  The first two changes support this requirement:

- `IJsonSchemaKeyword.RegisterSubschemas(Uri? baseUri, JsonSchemaRegistry localRegistry)` - The second parameter is new.
- `SchemaValidationContext` now requires a source context from which to copy values.
- `JsonSchemaOptions.OutputFormat` now has a default value of `Flag`, which only returns whether an instance is valid, without any error details.  This greatly improves performance out of the box.  Configuration is required to generate error details.
- `JsonSchemaoptions.RefResolutionStrategy` now has a default value of `ProcessSiblingId` to conform with the draft-08 definition of `$ref` and `$recursiveRef`.

Additionally, it was pointed out on [the JSON Schema spec repo](https://github.com/json-schema-org/json-schema-spec/issues/759) that `format` is not specifically intended for strings, but can also be used to validate other types.  To address this, the `StringFormat` type has been renamed to `Format` and now accepts `JsonValue` instead of merely `string`, although one string formats are defined by the spec.  Formatting for other types as well as their validation logic will need to be provided by the consumer (you).

### Serialization

- `IResolver.Resolve<T>()` removed since it wasn't used internally anywhere.
- `IResolver.Resolve(Type, Dictionary<SerializationInfo, object>)` - The second parameter is new.

### Other breaking changes

Dropped multi-target support.  Now only targeting .Net Standard 2.0.  This is still compatible with .Net Framework 4.6.1 and higher.

### Obsolete items removed

- `SchemaErrorMessages` - Error messages are now customizable via the `ErrorTemplate` static property on those keywords which have it.
- `FluentBuilderExtensions.Items(this JsonSchema, params JsonSchema[])` - The compiler could not distinguish between the single-schema usage of `items` and the array-usage which only contained a single schema.  Instead, multiple calls to `Item` should be used.  This is also more consistent with how `Definition` and `Property` work.

## Non-breaking changes

([#175](https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Json/issues/175)) JSON Schema draft-08 support.  

([#209](https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Json/issues/209)) `PropertiesKeyword` does not return nested results.  This was fixed as part of #175.

([#205](https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Json/issues/205)) Schema equality doesn't capture extra properties on second schema.  E.g. for `a.Equals(b)` if `b` has a property that doesn't exist in `a`, `.Equals()` still returns true.  The collection comparison has been fixed.

([#201](https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Json/issues/201)) CompilerAttributes causes errors in .Net Standard versions.  This dependency has been removed.

([#211](https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Json/issues/211)) [@desmondgc](https://github.com/desmondgc) Date/Time format validation within schemas is insufficient.  Default implementation now uses `DateTime.TryParseExact()` with support for fractional seconds.

([#219](https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Json/issues/219)) `$ref` resolution fails when using a relative URI as the `$id` for the root schema.  Added a new option `JsonSchemaOptions.DefaultBaseUri` as suggested by the spec.  The default value for this option is `manatee://json-schema/`.

- `JsonSchemaRegistry` is no longer static, but all previously existing functionality is still static.  All instance functionality is internal.
- Minor memory usage improvements for JSON Schema validation.
- Added the following to `JsonSchemaOptions` to more finely control the output, which can have a significant effect on performance.
  - `IgnoreErrorsForChildren<T>()` - Prevents collection of errors and annotations generated by subschemas for a given keyword throughout the entire schema structure.
  - `IgnoreErrorsForChildren(JsonPointer)` - Prevents collection of errors and annotations generated by subschemas of a specified location within the schema.
  - `ShouldReportChildErrors(IJsonSchemaKeyword, SchemaValidationContext)` - To be used by custom keywords, determines whether errors and annotations should be reported based on the above settings.

*Released on 14 May, 2019*

<span id="patch">patch</span>

([#203](https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Json/issues/203)) Adjacent (consecutive) escape sequences that contained Unicode values were always considered as a surrogate pair even if they were just two separate characters.

<span id="feature">feature</span> <span id="patch">patch</span>

Expanded on the fixes from 10.0.5 and added the `JsonSchemaOptions.AllowUnknownFormats` static property to control behavior when unknown string formats are encountered.

# 10.0.5

*Released on 15 Nov, 2018*

<span id="patch">patch</span>

([#193](https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Json/issues/193)) Invalid string formats were not being included in the schema validation result data when the format was not recognized.  It would just fail.  Now the result object will contain a new `isKnownFormat` key in the `AdditionalInfo` property to indicate whether the specified keyword was recognized.

([#194](https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Json/issues/194)) Schema validations that occurred through `$ref` keywords were not being reported at all.  Instead the report would state that the error occurred at the `$ref`, but would give no further information.

# 10.0.4

*Released on 8 Oct, 2018*

<span id="patch">patch</span>

User-defined serialization should have priority over built-in ones.

Enum deserialization should be smarter about detecting numeric or string formatting.

# 10.0.0

*Released on 30 Sep, 2018*

<span id="break">breaking change</span> <span id="feature">feature</span>

## Summary

([#147](https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Json/issues/147)) Updated how custom serialization is handled.  Rather than registering independent methods (`CustomSerializations`), custom sub-serializer implementations that each handle specific scenarios can be registered.  Each implementation specifies whether it can handle the (de)serialization based on the expected type, the serializer options, and (for deserialization, specifically) the JSON value.  It will also specify whether it should maintain referential integrity.

([#132](https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Json/issues/132)) Changed parsing and schema errors to use JSON Pointers to indicate the locations of errors instead of JSON Paths.  The reasoning behind this is JSON Path is a query syntax that can return multiple values, whereas JSON Pointer was specifically designed to represent a single path resulting in a single value.

([#175](https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Json/issues/175) (Part 1) In preparation for JSON Schema draft-08, the JSON Schema implementation has been overhauled.  The key takeaways from this work are:

- The schema drafts are no longer represented by multiple classes, but rather a single `JsonSchema` class that is capable of modeling all of the drafts.
- The `JsonSchema` type does not expose keywords as properties, but is a container of keyword implementations.  This allows for easier extension.

([#112](https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Json/issues/112)) Another change intended to support JSON Schem draft-08 is a [standardized output format](https://github.com/json-schema-org/json-schema-spec/issues/643).  The validation results have been restructured to conform to this proposal.

([#177](https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Json/issues/177)) Opened up the `StringFormat` class (schema `format` keyword) for extension and customization.

([#152](https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Json/issues/152)) Updated referential integrity for serialization to use JSON Pointers that point elsewhere in the structure instead of the previous `#Def` and `#Ref` tags.  Now you will see something more like `{"$ref":"#/property1/array/3/data"}` in the serialized JSON for references.  The idea of the `#Def` tag has been removed.

*In addition to the below listings, the entire JSON Schema implementation has been overhauled.  Please see the JSON Schema documentation for details.*

### Changes

- `JsonSyntaxException` - `string Path` property replaced by `JsonPointer Location` property.
- `JsonOptions.PrettyPrintIndent` - Updated from `char` to `string` to support indentations like multiple spaces.

### New types

- `SerializerFactory`
- `ISerializer`

### Removed types

- `CustomSerializations`
- `JsonSerializationAbstractionMap` (previously obsolete)
- `JsonSerializationTypeRegistry` (previously obsolete)
- `TypeRegistrationException`

### Functional changes

- Updated the default enumeration serialization method from using numeric values to using named values.  (See `JsonSerializerOptions.EnumSerializationFormat`.)
